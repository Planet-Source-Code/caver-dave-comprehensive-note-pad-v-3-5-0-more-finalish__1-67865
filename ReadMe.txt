UPDATE  17/08/07 Version 3.0.0 finalish

Barring any major bugs or any further minor revisions this application is now complete. As an exercise in code hacking along with code writing it has been a success and produced what I believe is, if not the, best of it of its type then one of the best on PSC. Thanks go to all those, both unwittingly and knowingly, that have provided code and to all those that have helped along the way

UPDATE:18/02/07
In response to the comments that have been made regarding v 1.0.0 I have added a find and replace dialogue all the tool tips for the function buttons are now in place, along with a basic spell checker that uses a brew it yourself word list. 
One major modification has been to add a line spacing function, this is I think the only one of its kind on planet source code!, this has added to a better presentation of the text when required.

They say that every programmer should write atleast 1 text editor and this one is in response to a challenge from a friend of mine, he wanted a replacement for notepad and a bit more so I decided to trump his ace.

I have created a big bold sdi notepad with lots of buttons and more to come!and probably a tabbed interface for multiple file opening and editing and much, much more

This is going to be an on going project i hope to be posting updates to it once a month
The code is not all mine and the main credits are on the about screen:
                      credits go to GioRock, Herman liu, Wazerface & Nite4000

Most of the code is mine it has just been the oddities that i have had to garner along with some hints from others' code on psc along the way

This code is open source change it, bend it, do what u will with it just give credit where credit is due.

and if you like it vote for it! 
all constructive criticism welcome!
